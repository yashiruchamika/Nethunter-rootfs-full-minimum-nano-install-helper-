# Nethunter-rootfs-full-minimum-nano-install-helper-
I tried to solve some of the problems that occur during the installation of NetHunter.
Kali Net Hunter is the official app, and all I did was fix some of the issues I encountered during installation. 

git clone https://github.com/yashiru1365/Nethunter-rootfs-full-minimum-nano-install-helper-

cd Nethunter-rootfs-full-minimum-nano-install-helper-

chmod +x nethinstl.sh

./nethinstl.sh
